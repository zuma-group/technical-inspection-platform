**Files to modify:**
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` (new)
- `middleware.ts` (new)

- [ ] Fix all `any` types throughout codebase
- [ ] Add proper interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Fix optional chaining issues
- [ ] Add proper return types for all functions
- [ ] Remove all TypeScript errors

**Key files with type issues:**
- `app/inspect/[id]/client.tsx` (has several `any` types)
- `app/dashboard/actions.ts` (needs better typing)
- All action files need proper return type interfaces

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Set up Playwright for E2E testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for:
  - [ ] Server actions
  - [ ] Database queries
  - [ ] Validation functions
  - [ ] Utility functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for:
  - [ ] Equipment CRUD operations
  - [ ] Inspection workflow
  - [ ] Template management
  - [ ] Media upload/retrieval
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### 5. Error Boundaries & User Feedback
**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡
- [ ] Add React Error Boundaries to catch client-side errors
- [ ] Implement global error handler
- [ ] Add loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Add success/error toast notifications
- [ ] Improve error messages to be user-friendly
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates with proper rollback

**Components to create:**
- `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- `components/Toast.tsx`
- `components/LoadingSpinner.tsx`

## Priority 3: Performance & User Experience

### 6. Performance Optimizations
**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡
- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Add pagination for equipment and inspection lists
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long checkpoint lists
- [ ] Add database query caching with Redis
- [ ] Optimize image loading with lazy loading
- [ ] Implement proper code splitting
- [ ] Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals)

### 7. Offline Support
**Priority: LOW** 🟢
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Add IndexedDB for local data storage
- [ ] Implement sync mechanism when back online
- [ ] Cache critical assets for offline use
- [ ] Add offline indicator in UI
- [ ] Queue actions when offline

### 8. Progressive Web App (PWA)
**Priority: LOW** 🟢
- [ ] Add web app manifest
- [ ] Implement install prompt
- [ ] Add app icons for all platforms
- [ ] Configure splash screens
- [ ] Add push notifications support

## Priority 4: Additional Features

### 9. Advanced Features
**Priority: LOW** 🟢
- [ ] Add equipment QR code scanning
- [ ] Implement inspection scheduling
- [ ] Add email notifications for overdue inspections
- [ ] Create inspection reports (PDF export)
- [ ] Add equipment maintenance history
- [ ] Implement parts inventory tracking
- [ ] Add cost tracking for repairs
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard with charts
- [ ] Add bulk import/export functionality
- [ ] Implement audit trail for all actions

### 10. API Security Enhancements
**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡
- [ ] Add rate limiting (using Redis or similar)
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for external access
- [ ] Add request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement CORS properly
- [ ] Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Add API versioning
- [ ] Implement request ID tracking
